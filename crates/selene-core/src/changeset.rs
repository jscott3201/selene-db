//! WAL change payloads per spec 02 section 9.
//!
//! The principal/audit actor lives in the WAL entry header per D12; these
//! payloads carry only the graph mutation itself. Diff payloads keep key lists
//! in canonical lexicographic order by [`DbString::as_str`] both in memory and on
//! the wire (the derived [`DbString`] `Ord` is lexicographic through the inner
//! string). Serialize canonicalizes (sorts) the lists before emitting — a no-op
//! for diffs built via the constructors, but load-bearing because the diff
//! fields are public and can be set non-canonically. Deserialize then validates
//! the canonical invariant and rejects a non-canonical or out-of-order payload
//! as malformed rather than re-sorting it.
