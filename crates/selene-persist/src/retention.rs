//! Snapshot + WAL-archive retention: typed policy and MANIFEST-atomic prune.
//!
//! Per the 2026-05-26 deletion+reclamation audit (Item 5 / D26), a v1.0
//! persistence directory grows without bound: every rotation publishes a new
//! `snapshot.{seq}.snap` and a new `wal.{seq}.archive`, and nothing ever
//! reclaims the superseded ones. [`prune`] is the engine-side escape valve.
//!
//! # The retention floor (load-bearing safety invariant)
//!
//! Prune **never** deletes anything required to recover the live epoch. The
//! snapshot named by the MANIFEST's [`Manifest::live_snapshot_seq`] and the
//! active WAL ([`Manifest::active_wal`]) are sacrosanct regardless of policy —
//! even `keep_n_snapshots = 0` retains the live snapshot. WAL archives are
//! fully prunable because the live snapshot subsumes every change they hold;
//! they are kept only for point-in-time / forensic recovery.
//!
//! # Crash safety (the MANIFEST commit-point invariant)
//!
//! Prune mirrors rotation's ordering: rewrite the MANIFEST *first* (the atomic
//! rename is the single linearization point), delete files *after*. A crash
//! before the rewrite leaves the prior MANIFEST and every file intact; a crash
//! after it leaves orphan files that recovery already ignores (it opens only
//! `live_snapshot_seq` and the archives named by the committed MANIFEST), and
//! the next prune reclaims them. The MANIFEST is therefore never observed
//! referencing a deleted archive.
//!
//! # Policy is configuration, not persisted state
//!
//! [`RetentionPolicy`] is supplied by the embedder at prune time, exactly like
//! [`crate::SnapshotConfig`]. It is deliberately *not* written into the
//! MANIFEST: a persisted policy would be a second source of truth that could
//! diverge from the embedder's configuration, the dual-write divergence the
//! audit's "single writer per concern" lesson rules out. The MANIFEST's
//! reserved `retention_present` byte stays reserved.
//!
//! # Prune cadence is the embedder's responsibility
//!
//! The MANIFEST's `archived_wal_seqs` vector gains one entry per rotation and is
//! only ever shrunk by [`prune`]; it is *not* soft-capped by the engine. An
//! embedder that never prunes therefore grows the vector — and the MANIFEST it
//! is re-encoded into every rotation — without bound. This is the documented
//! contract, not a defect: retention is opt-in engine policy, and bounding the
//! archive history is exactly what calling [`prune`] (or
//! [`crate::WalWriter::prune`]) on a cadence does. Prune is idempotent and
//! MANIFEST-atomic, so a periodic call is safe and a no-op when nothing is
//! reclaimable.
//!
//! # Serialization with rotation
//!
//! Prune holds the persistent [`crate::MANIFEST_LOCK_FILE_NAME`] lock from its
//! authoritative MANIFEST read through every post-commit deletion. WAL
//! rotation holds the same lock through its active-WAL reset. This makes the
//! two operations linear rather than allowing a stale prune plan to overwrite
//! a newer epoch or delete its just-published artifacts. The lock file is
//! permanent coordination state and must never be unlinked while the directory
//! may be in use.
