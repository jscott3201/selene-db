/// Open `path` as the WAL of a directory that does not yet hold a store.
///
/// Every path that attaches a WAL to a graph the engine did *not* just recover
/// goes through here, so the two cannot drift apart: the builder, and
/// [`SharedGraph::from_graph_with_wal`]. [`SharedGraph::recover`] deliberately
/// does not — it opens its writer only after replaying the store, which is the
/// whole point.
///
/// Three pieces of evidence, because no one of them is sufficient:
///
/// - **WAL entries.** `committed_offset` is seeded to the header length and
///   advances past it only once a valid entry has been scanned, so this is
///   exactly "the log already carries commits".
/// - **A published `MANIFEST` beside it.** Checkpoint rotation archives the
///   entries and resets the active WAL to a bare header, so a checkpointed
///   directory has an *empty-looking* WAL while its dataset sits in a snapshot.
///   Judging by the file alone would bless the state every long-lived directory
///   converges to. The header watermark cannot stand in for this: a brand-new
///   WAL created with a non-zero `snapshot_seq` has the identical header.
/// - **A `snapshot.N.snap` with no `MANIFEST`.** This is what
///   [`SharedGraph::write_snapshot`] exports, and recovery treats it as a
///   store: with no `MANIFEST` to consult it applies the highest on-disk
///   snapshot and seeds a fresh WAL header from that sequence. Attaching an
///   unrelated WAL beside one therefore writes a `snapshot_seq: 0` header that
///   recovery later cross-checks against the snapshot it just applied, and
///   refuses. Recovering the export directory is the operation that gets this
///   right.
///
/// Refusing drops the writer, which releases its lock and leaves the directory
/// exactly as it was found, ready for a recover call.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// Returns [`GraphError::Persist`] when the WAL cannot be opened, and
/// [`GraphError::ExistingStore`] when the directory already holds a store.
