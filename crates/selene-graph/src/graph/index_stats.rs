//! Diagnosable per-index statistics for the property-index families (#1102).
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! A typed property index cannot key a value whose variant does not match its
//! registered kind. Open graphs accept a value of any variant, so one ordinary
//! write can leave a live row the index cannot represent. Since #1099 such an
//! index *declines every probe* and callers fall back to a scan — correct, in
//! that queries keep returning the same rows either way, but silent: the index
//! is still registered, still listed by `SHOW INDEXES`, and answering nothing
//! from its own bitmaps.
//!
//! `drifted_rows` recorded that on the entry, but nothing projected it out of
//! `selene-graph`. `iter_property_index_entries` yields label/property/kind/name
//! only, and `selene.verify`'s coverage check deliberately probes through
//! `lookup_eq_ignoring_drift` — right for a corruption audit, but it means
//! verify reports a clean bill of health for a demoted index. The one remaining
//! trace was a `tracing::warn!` at write time, which an embedder with no
//! subscriber never sees.
//!
//! So an operator whose query got dramatically slower after a routine write had
//! no engine-visible way to find the cause. This module is the projection that
//! makes it findable; `selene.property_index_stats` is its query surface.
//!
//! # Why all three families
//!
//! Node single-property, edge single-property, and composite indexes each carry
//! their own `drifted_rows`. Surfacing one and not the others would recreate
//! exactly the blind spot being closed, so this walks all three and tags each
//! row with the entity it indexes.
