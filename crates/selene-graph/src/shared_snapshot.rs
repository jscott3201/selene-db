/// pruned, and at worst bricks recovery — a `snapshot.N.snap` with no MANIFEST
/// makes recovery cross-check it against the WAL and hard-fail with
/// `WalSnapshotMismatch`, which is the failure a downstream consumer reported.
///
/// Presence is the test, not content. A bare-header `wal.log` — a WAL-backed
/// graph that has not committed yet — declares an epoch whose sequence a
/// standalone write can still preclaim, so "has entries" would be too weak.
///
/// Known limit: this sees the conventional layout only. A graph whose WAL has a
/// non-default filename is already outside the managed contract — `recover`
/// looks for `wal.log` (`recover.rs`) and `checkpoint` refuses any other name
/// (`core_provider.rs`) — so such a directory cannot be recovered or
/// checkpointed either way.

    /// from `config`.
    ///
    /// This lower-level envelope writer is not coordinated with the graph
    /// committer or owned WAL, and it publishes no MANIFEST, so the snapshot it
    /// writes is not a recoverable epoch on its own. WAL-backed callers that
    /// need one should use [`SharedGraph::checkpoint`](crate::SharedGraph::checkpoint),
    /// which pins provider generation, snapshot sequence, durability, MANIFEST
    /// commit, and WAL rotation as a single committer work item.
    ///
    /// # The caller must exclude writes, and the target must be unmanaged
    ///
    /// Both halves are now enforced rather than merely documented:
    ///
    /// - A directory already holding a `MANIFEST` or a `wal.log` is refused, so
    ///   a standalone snapshot can no longer be dropped into a live store.
    /// - The section loop encodes at one pinned generation and re-checks that
    ///   the published graph was not replaced, so a commit, compaction, or
    ///   vector-index rebuild landing mid-encode fails loudly instead of
    ///   producing a snapshot torn across sections.
    ///
    /// The second check is an error, not a wait: this call does not quiesce
    /// anything, so a caller racing its own writers must serialize them and
    /// retry.

    /// holds a store, [`GraphError::Inconsistent`] when the graph was
    /// republished while encoding, [`GraphError::Provider`] when a provider
    /// cannot encode one of its declared sections at the pinned generation, and
    /// [`GraphError::Persist`] when the snapshot envelope cannot be finalized.
