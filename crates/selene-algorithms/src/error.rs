//! Error surface for `selene-algorithms`.

//! Per spec 16 §3 E04, weight extraction is infallible — there are no
//! `WeightProperty*` variants. The starter enum carries only consumer-facing
//! variants algorithms raise to signal "your input is not algorithm-meaningful."

//! `#[non_exhaustive]` lets BRIEFs 52–55 (structural / pathfinding / centrality
//! / community) extend with algorithm-specific variants without breaking the
//! crate's public API.
