# BRIEF-Item-4a guard (internal/external NodeId split, D22).
#
# Forbids reconstructing an external id from a storage row (`row + 1`) or a row
# from an external id (`id - 1`) via arithmetic in production read paths. The
# external NodeId/EdgeId is stable and never-reused; the internal RowIndex is
# remappable by compaction (BRIEF-Item-4b), so `id == row + 1` no longer holds.
# Read paths MUST convert through SeleneGraph's map-backed accessors:
#   row_for_node_id / row_for_edge_id   (external id -> RowIndex)
#   node_id_for_row / edge_id_for_row   (RowIndex -> external id)
# The binding-authority helper `node_row_index_arith` / `edge_row_index_arith`
# (create_* and the recovery WAL-replay fallback in into_graph) is the only
# sanctioned id->row arithmetic. The snapshot encoder no longer synthesizes ids
# (STEP 9: it persists the explicit id from the row_to_id column), and recovery
# places snapshot rows positionally.
#
# A handful of legitimate row->id sites (the recovery identity bootstrap in
# shared.rs::rebuild_id_maps for externally-built graphs that never populated
# row_to_id) are annotated with a trailing `// rowid-arith-ok: <reason>` and
# excluded here.
#
# Scope: production source of the split-affected crates. Test/bench fixtures
# (which legitimately build identity-mapped data) and other crates (e.g.
# selene-vector's own slot<->id mapping) are out of scope.
