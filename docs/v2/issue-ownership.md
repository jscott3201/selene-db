# Open issue ownership

Each issue open at installation has one 2.0 implementation owner. Foundation
work may reference an issue but must not close it before the owning PR produces
direct acceptance evidence.

resolution. Moving ownership requires REPLAN and coordinated changes to the
issue map, machine plan, projections, and both affected contracts.
