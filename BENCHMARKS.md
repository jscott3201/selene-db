# selene-db benchmarks

_Last measured: 2026-06-01 on Apple M5 (10-core / 16 GiB / macOS 26.5 build 25F71 / rustc 1.95.0 / commit `3a864ac`)._

This file is the **north-star performance baseline** for selene-db: the medians
below are the reference point for performance-uplift work and the tripwire for
regressions. Every benchmark bin registered in `scripts/run-benches.sh` is
documented here — that parity is CI-enforced (fast-gate
`.github/scripts/check-benchmarks-doc.sh` + release-gate
`crates/selene-testing/tests/benchmarks_md_pin.rs`), so a bench can never ship
undocumented (the historical `expression_eval` orphan).

The suite is **criterion-only** (wall-clock medians on the dev box). There is no
iai-callgrind instruction-count layer — it needs valgrind, which never runs on
the macOS dev machine, so it was dropped rather than left as a perpetually-TBD
placeholder.

## Running benchmarks

`scripts/run-benches.sh` is the sanctioned entry point. Direct `cargo bench
--workspace` is **forbidden** (Cargo may dispatch bench binaries concurrently,
which corrupts wall-clock medians); the runner executes strictly one binary at a
time, guarded by a `pgrep` check and a serial run loop.

The runner is **flexibly scoped** so you never have to fire up a whole run to
check one thing:

```bash
run-benches.sh --list                          # enumerate registered benches + smoke subset
run-benches.sh --smoke                          # curated <~60s tripwire subset (profile quick)
run-benches.sh                                  # FULL run, every bench (the north-star sweep)
run-benches.sh --bench wal                      # one bench bin (scoped compile + run)
run-benches.sh --bench vector_graph_retrieval --compile-only  # compile tripwire, no Criterion run
run-benches.sh --crate selene-db-graph          # every bench in one package

### Profiles

The workload envelope is selected by `SELENE_BENCH_PROFILE` (set via `--profile`;
see `crates/selene-testing/src/bench_profiles.rs`):

| Profile | Scales | Sample / measurement | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `quick` | one 1k scale | 10 / 500 ms | fast spot-check / smoke |
| `full` (default) | 10k / 50k / 100k | 30 / 1500 ms | **publish-quality / this doc** |
| `stress` | adds 250k | 30 / 1500 ms | opt-in larger envelope |

Vector benches also accept an independent runner override with
`--vector-scales`. The flag exports both `SELENE_VECTOR_BENCH_SCALES` and
`SELENE_VECTOR_REBUILD_BENCH_SCALES`, so it covers exact/ANN query sweeps and
index rebuild sweeps without changing non-vector benches.

`vector_ivf_insert_drift` also accepts
`SELENE_VECTOR_IVF_INSERT_DRIFT_BPS` as a comma-separated basis-point sweep over
post-training novel inserts. The default remains `1000` (10%) so routine runs
keep the historical row count; use `100,500,1000` for the maintenance-policy
threshold sweep.

For `vector_index_rebuild`, Criterion's positional `--filter` is mirrored into
`SELENE_VECTOR_REBUILD_GROUP_FILTER` and
`SELENE_VECTOR_REBUILD_VARIANT_FILTER=ivf|hnsw` when the filter names a rebuild
group or ANN family. Those prefilters skip irrelevant fixture construction, so
focused large-scale IVF or HNSW runs do not pay preview costs for unrelated
groups or the other family.

| Vector scale selector | Scales | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `quick` | 1k | fast vector smoke |
| `full` | 10k / 50k / 100k | publish-quality vector sweep |
| `stress` | 1k / 10k / 50k / 100k / 250k | opt-in stress sweep |
| `large` | 250k / 1M | local large-scale validation |
| `million` | 1M | focused million-vector run |
| comma list | sorted positive integers | custom A/B scale envelope |

A few benches sweep an independent axis instead of the node-scale envelope (hub
degree, WAL entry-body packing, WAL sync policy, writer fan-in, correlated-row
count); those are profile-trimmed too so `quick` stays fast.

## Tracking regressions

The full sweep saves a named criterion baseline so later runs report a
percentage delta instead of a bare median:

```bash
run-benches.sh --profile full --save-baseline northstar     # record this doc's baseline
# … later, after an optimization or to check for a regression …
run-benches.sh --bench graph_hub_delete --baseline northstar # %-change vs northstar
```

`--save-baseline` and `--baseline` are mutually exclusive (one records, one
compares). criterion stores baselines under `target/criterion/` (gitignored, so
local to your machine); the committed baseline of record is the number tables in
this file. Refresh both together (see [Update protocol](#update-protocol)) on a
quiet machine — background load pollutes the medians.

## Hardware footprint

| Field | Value | Source |
|---|---|---|
| CPU | Apple M5 | `sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string` |
| Cores | 10 physical / 10 logical | `sysctl -n hw.physicalcpu hw.logicalcpu` |
| Memory | 16.0 GiB | `sysctl -n hw.memsize` |
| OS | macOS 26.5 (build 25F71) | `sw_vers` |
| rustc | 1.95.0 (59807616e 2026-04-14) | `rustc --version` |
| Commit | `3a864ac` | `git rev-parse --short HEAD` |

All committed benchmark rows use `mimalloc` as the global allocator; the library
crates are allocator-agnostic. For allocator A/B work, run the same scoped bench
twice with `--allocator mimalloc` (the default) and `--allocator system`.
Criterion writes per-run artifacts under `target/criterion`. After a sanctioned
runner invocation, `scripts/criterion-summary.sh <criterion-id>` prints
tab-separated sample count, median, mean, standard deviation, and sample p95 in
milliseconds for quick variance checks.

## §1 selene-core

Bench bins: `value_clone`, `vector_wgpu`. `value_clone` measures `Value` /
`PropertyMap` clone cost: every clone memcpys the whole enum regardless of the
active variant, then pays the active variant's owned/shared payload cost. A
compile-time `size_of::<Value>() <= 32` ceiling in `value.rs` is the zero-cost
re-bloat tripwire; the bench prints the live size to stderr. **Measured
`size_of::<Value>() = 32 bytes`** at this commit — CORE-06 boxed the four
oversized variants (`Path` 120 B — the real former ceiling, not the time
variants — plus `Duration`/`ZonedDateTime`/`ZonedTime`), down from 128 B.
`DbString` now stores `Arc<str>`, so string values, labels, and property keys
clone by sharing storage rather than copying string bytes.
The same bin also covers open and compact property-map construction paths so
`from_pairs` stays linearithmic rather than repeated-insert quadratic for
schema- or record-shaped maps with many properties, plus common one-property
compact-map construction, compact-map encoding, and mutation diff constructors.
Already-canonical `from_pairs` inputs are tracked separately from reverse-sorted
inputs so the constructor can skip redundant sort/dedup work without regressing
the non-canonical path. Compact-map 256-key rows mirror that guard for closed
schema-shaped maps. Standard/compact property-map postcard encode rows pin the
canonical WAL/snapshot serialization path separately from construction cost.
The `core_change_diff/*` rows cover canonical WAL diff constructors so mutation
payload construction and postcard serialization stay cheap when callers already
have sorted property keys.
The `core_label_set/*` rows cover high-cardinality label-set construction; most
runtime rows stay at one to three labels, but schema and test fixtures can build
larger sets and should not pay repeated insertion shifts.
The `core_vector_value/*` rows are the first native vector
baselines: validation/construction, `Arc<[f32]>` clone cost, and postcard
round-trip cost at common embedding dimensions. The `core_vector_distance/*`
and `core_vector_exact_top_k/*` rows are exact-search oracle baselines for the
future ANN layer; current kernels use safe `wide::f64x4` accumulation over the
existing `f64` score semantics, so these rows are the SIMD/Rayon improvement
tripwire. The `cosine_omlx_*` exact-top-k rows pin product-shaped local embedding
dimensions and candidate widths without depending on the localhost oMLX service.
The `core_vector_gpu_baseline/*` rows are CPU/SIMD and host-pack envelopes for
future optional GPU acceleration: a Metal/CUDA backend must beat these rerank
times after any setup and host/device transfer costs, not just win a kernel
microbenchmark. The split host-pack rows model warm GPU-resident candidates
versus cold candidate upload/resync, and the resident-slab CPU rows show the
layout-only speedup from prepacked contiguous candidates plus cached norms.
`vector_wgpu` is the first benchmark-only wgpu compute prototype. It keeps
candidate vectors resident in GPU buffers, optionally rewrites the query batch,
scores every query/candidate pair with a WGSL cosine kernel, reads all scores
back to the host, and validates a score prefix against the CPU oracle during
setup. The default case list includes q8/q16 over 4,096 candidates, a
2560-dimension larger-embedding row, and q8/q16 over 10,000 candidates. A
100,000-candidate q8/d1024 row is opt-in with `SELENE_WGPU_STRESS_CASES=1`.
The newest rows compare a Rayon CPU score+top-k path against fused WGPU
score+block-top-k kernels that avoid full score-buffer readback, including a
parallel in-workgroup top-k reducer probe and q16 hot-shard x8 reuse rows. It
also registers the Rayon rows when WGPU adapter discovery fails, so local Metal
availability issues do not hide the CPU-parallel baseline. It is not a
production accelerator API.

| `core_vector_wgpu_prototype/resident_query_copy_score_readback/q8x10000x1024` | 4.4663 ms (quick) | Warm resident 10,000-candidate q8 row. Larger candidate windows improve throughput but full score readback still beats the simple block reducer. |
| `core_vector_wgpu_prototype/resident_preloaded_score_readback/q8x10000x1024` | 4.1366 ms (quick) | Preloaded query q8/10k row; still close to query-copy because query payload is tiny. |

| `core_vector_wgpu_prototype/resident_query_copy_score_fused_block_topk_cpu_merge/q8x10000x1024` | 2.5989 ms (quick) | Fused WGPU score plus block-local top-k over 10,000 candidates. This is a clear win over full readback, the older block reducer, and Rayon CPU score+top-k. |
| `core_vector_wgpu_prototype/resident_query_copy_score_parallel_block_topk_cpu_merge/q8x10000x1024` | 2.6617 ms (quick) | Parallel in-workgroup top-k probe over 10,000 candidates. It is slightly behind the simpler fused row (`2.6157 ms` in the same quick run), so parallel reduction is not yet a clear replacement. |

| `core_vector_wgpu_prototype/resident_preloaded_score_readback/q16x10000x1024` | 7.6760 ms (quick) | Same q16/10k path with preloaded queries; effectively tied with query-copy at this scale. |
| `core_vector_wgpu_prototype/cold_candidate_upload_score_readback/q16x10000x1024` | 11.219 ms (quick) | Cold upload for the q16/10k row; upload still matters but scales better as query batch size rises. |

| `core_vector_wgpu_prototype/resident_query_copy_score_gpu_block_topk_cpu_merge/q16x10000x1024` | 8.0790 ms (quick) | Block-local top-k is now close to full readback plus CPU ranking, but still not better enough to justify productionizing the current serial reducer. |
| `core_vector_wgpu_prototype/resident_query_copy_score_fused_block_topk_cpu_merge/q16x10000x1024` | 3.8601 ms (quick) | Fused WGPU score plus block-local top-k at q16/10k. This is the strongest WGPU row so far: about 2.1x faster than full readback plus CPU top-k and 3.4x faster than Rayon CPU score+top-k in the same quick run. |
| `core_vector_wgpu_prototype/resident_query_copy_score_parallel_block_topk_cpu_merge/q16x10000x1024` | 3.9287 ms (quick) | Parallel in-workgroup top-k probe at q16/10k.

| `core_vector_wgpu_prototype/cpu_rayon_score_topk/q8x100000x1024` | 61.066 ms (quick, `SELENE_WGPU_STRESS_CASES=1`) | Opt-in 100k stress CPU-parallel baseline: ~13.1 Melem/s for 800,000 query/candidate cosine top-k scores. Same run skipped WGPU rows because wgpu compiled only `METAL` for this target and enumerated `available_adapters=none`; the harness now reports compiled backends, enumerated adapters, and attempted power preferences before falling back to the Rayon row. |

## §2 selene-graph — read hot paths

Bench bins: `single_graph`, `vector_index_rebuild`, `vector_pq`,
`vector_ivf_pq`, `vector_turbo_projection`, `vector_turbo_churn`, `vector_ivf_pressure`, `vector_mixed_workload`,
`bulk_mutation`, `concurrent_read`, `bfs`, `text_search_bm25`. The medians below predate CORE-06 (measured at the 128 B `Value`
layout); now that `Value` is 32 B, the `PropertyMap`-clone-heavy rows
(`graph_edge_create_cascade`, `graph_mutation_commit_batch`) will tighten at
the next full re-baseline. `graph_node_fetch` returns a column ref (no `Value`
clone) and is unaffected. `graph_exact_vector_scan/*` is the native graph-level
exact-vector oracle: label-filtered row scan plus the core vector metric
kernels, returning stable node ids. Large exact scans use threshold-gated Rayon
for both unindexed label rows and flat-index row sets; cancellation/deadline
aware calls check once per chunk and keep the same parallel path. Large
`graph_vector_candidate_set/*` reranks use the same chunked cancellation-aware
Rayon primitive once a single set reaches the 4,096-candidate threshold.
Exact batch cosine scans reuse one candidate squared norm across the query
batch; candidate-set batch reranking intentionally keeps the fused per-query
cosine kernel because a separate candidate-norm pass regressed q64/d1024 rows.
Canonical candidate-set batch scoring uses query-level Rayon once the batch has
at least 4,096 total candidates spread across multiple sets, keeping each
per-query scan serial inside that branch so many-query batches do not nest
chunked reductions. Explicit node batch scoring normalizes to canonical
candidate sets once, then delegates to the same batch scorer. Graph-expanded
candidate-set batches parallelize root-set expansion only when the batch has at
least 16 root sets and a sampled estimate projects at least 8,192 expanded
candidates; smaller expanded batches stay serial to avoid Rayon overhead. The
neighbor batch scorer reuses one derived candidate set when every query uses the
same graph anchor, then falls back to sampled thresholded derivation for broad
distinct-anchor batches before entering canonical candidate-set batch scoring.
The candidate-set group also measures the Rust graph/vector boundary for deriving
canonical candidate sets from graph adjacency and reranking canonical candidate
sets by vector score.
`graph_vector_index_rebuild/*` times the
maintenance rebuild that reclaims stale ANN entries after vector update/delete
churn; `graph_vector_index_recommended_rebuild/*` compares recommended-only
maintenance against full rebuild on a multi-index IVF fixture where only one
index is above the rebuild threshold. `graph_text_bm25_exact/*` is the
dependency-light full-text correctness oracle: it scans string properties,
computes query-local BM25 statistics, and returns deterministic top-k text hits.
`graph_text_bm25_indexed/*` compares a reusable in-memory postings index against
the oracle: `prebuilt_*` is the repeated-query path, while `transient_*` includes
index construction so build cost stays visible. Fixture setup is excluded from
the reported Criterion duration. `graph_json_contains_scan/*`,
`graph_json_path_exists_scan/*`, `graph_json_path_contains_scan/*`, and
`graph_json_path_value_scan/*` are exact JSON metadata oracles over JSON-valued
node properties before maintained JSON/path indexes exist. Global JSON scans use
threshold-gated Rayon when the label row set has at least 16,384 rows, including
deadline-bearing checked calls; candidate-scoped JSON scans remain sequential
because they sort/dedup and can stop once `k` matches are found.
`graph_edge_property_scan/*`, `graph_edge_property_index_lookup/*`, and
`graph_point_connected_traversal/*` are edge-index sprint rows over an
open-control-shaped `CdlBlock`/`Point` fixture: the first scans `CONNECTED_TO`
edge-label rows and filters edge properties, the second uses the built-in
edge-property typed index, and the third walks `Point` nodes through labeled
adjacency before checking target metadata.
`graph_snapshot_read_loops/*` amortizes thread setup over many
`SharedGraph::read()` calls so the ArcSwap snapshot hot path is visible; the
older `graph_concurrent_reads` row remains a legacy spawn/join smoke row.
The focused `graph_vector_index_ivf_target_centroid_rebuild/*` group sweeps
explicit IVF list-count targets on the same rebuild fixture so read-side
candidate pressure can be compared against write-side retrain/reassignment cost.
`vector_pq` is a benchmark-only quantized candidate generator for
compression/recall research: PQ, dequantized scalar u8, scalar u8 code-space
distance, packed binary sign codes, and a portable TurboQuant-style scorer
produce short candidate sets, then full-fidelity vectors are exact reranked.
The TurboQuant-style row is intentionally benchmark-only: it uses safe scalar
bit-packed codes and deterministic orthogonal mixing to ground storage/recall
trade-offs before any production TurboVec-derived index or storage policy.
`vector_ivf_pq` adds a coarse synthetic IVF-style partition ahead of PQ,
scalar code-space, and binary scorers so future work can compare standalone
full-code scans against candidate-producer plus compression layering.
`vector_turbo_projection` sweeps the benchmark-only TurboQuant scorer across
128/768/1536 dimensions at a fixed 10k-row scale so storage ratio and safe
block-Hadamard rotation behavior are visible before production codec work. Its
production `TurboQuantCosine` rows track the current omitted search-width
default (`512`) across single, batch, filtered, filtered-batch, and
shared-filtered-batch search.
`vector_turbo_churn` applies the standard 10% vector update / 5% delete churn
shape to a 10k-row production `TurboQuantCosine` index and times approximate
search over the churned derived state at the current omitted search-width
default (`512`). It also times `TurboQuantCosine` index creation over the same
10k-row, 128-dimensional graph shape plus a 2k-row, 1536-dimensional graph
shape so online indexing cost stays visible for embedding-sized vectors.
`vector_ivf_pressure` uses the
production graph IVF index and records list-skew plus candidate-pressure
suffixes so future IVF/PQ layering work is grounded against real index fanout
under the expected 60% read / 40% write workload. It also includes the
`graph_ivf_target_centroids` sweep for explicit IVF list-count tuning.
`vector_mixed_workload` includes capped-maintenance cadence rows that compare
rebuilding one recommended IVF index per maintenance pass against rebuilding
every recommended IVF index after repeated 60/40 cycles. Vector benchmark IDs
include a memory/cardinality suffix:
`m{index KiB}-{reachable KiB}_n{indexed rows}_{flat|he...|ve...}`. The
`he...` form carries HNSW entries/live/deleted entries plus link counters; the
`ve...` form carries IVF entries/live/deleted entries plus centroid/list
counters. ANN recall IDs encode exact-ID recall as `idbp{basis points}` and
tie-tolerant nearest-distance quality as `dqbp{basis points}` before that
memory suffix.
unindexed rows use `noidx`. Rebuild IDs add
`upd{updates}_del{deletes}_b{entries-live-deleted}_a{entries-live-deleted}_rk{reclaimed reachable KiB}`.
Recommended-rebuild IDs add
`idx{registered indexes}_rb{rebuilt indexes}_pend{pending retrain entries}_bp{pending basis points}`.
Stale-query IDs use
`{stale|rebuilt}_n{rows}_{h|v}e{entries}l{live}d{deleted}_m{index KiB}-{reachable KiB}`,
where `h` is HNSW and `v` is IVF.
IVF pressure IDs use
`lists{centroids}ne{non_empty}max{max_list_len}avg{avg_list_len}avgq{avg_candidates_per_query}maxq{worst_case_candidates_per_query}_m{index KiB}-{reachable KiB}`.

Maintained BM25 remains the preferred read path when lexical/current-state
quality is sufficient, but body-update-heavy workloads should treat text-index
maintenance as a first-class write-side bottleneck before adding richer text or
JSON indexing surfaces.

Rejected variants: sharing postings while leaving per-document term lists as
plain `Vec<String>` kept transient build lower at 523.57 µs but lost the update
win (`write_registered_update_w40/n1000` returned to 5.0114 ms). Wrapping
document terms as `Arc<Vec<String>>` instead of `Arc<[String]>` worsened the
transient build row to 580.25 µs, so the accepted representation uses
`Arc<[String]>` document terms plus a bulk builder.

PR-local explicit IVF target-centroid sweep:

| Variant | 1k perfect-recall knee | 10k perfect-recall knee | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `ivf_default` | width 2 / 94.80 µs | width 2 / 139.67 µs | Default `ceil(sqrt(n))` list count: 32 lists at 1k, 100 lists at 10k. Width 2 reaches 10000 bp recall/quality at both scales and remains the current 10k knee. |
| `ivf_c16` | width 2 / 82.25 µs | width 1 / 621.23 µs | Low list count keeps recall perfect but creates very large 10k lists (`avg625`, max ~2k), so read cost scales poorly despite low centroid-scoring overhead. |
| `ivf_c128` | width 4 / 66.46 µs | width 2 / 137.30 µs | At 1k, 128 lists with width 4 is the fastest perfect-recall row; at 10k, width 2 is slightly faster than default while using more centroid-scoring work. |
| `ivf_c512` | no perfect row at width <= 4 | width 2 / 230.78 µs | High list count reduces candidate rows but pays heavy centroid scoring. On 1k it only reaches 7750 bp at width 4; on 10k width 2 is perfect but slower than default/c128 width 2. |

After graph-level ANN row-hit conversion stopped re-heaping already bounded index
hits, the same quick run measured width 1 / 2 / 4 / 64 at 92.38 µs / 140.91 µs /
254.37 µs / 2.997 ms. The delta is intentionally treated as noise-scale at
`k=10`; the value is avoiding redundant heap work on the read path while
preserving dead-row filtering and deterministic `NodeId` tie ordering.

The same pressure bench also carries a `k=50` top-k sweep to catch wider
agent-memory retrieval requests. On the 10k clustered-cosine fixture, width 1
falls to 8725 bp recall/quality at ~112.4 µs, while width 2 restores 10000 bp at
~160.8 µs. Width 4 / 8 / 64 remain perfect-recall guardrails at ~274.4 µs /
~494.1 µs / ~3.065 ms.

PR-local IVF incremental-insert drift spot-check. Bench IDs include
`_d{basis_points}bp`; the suffix also includes pending-retrain pressure as
`pend{count}pdbp{basis_points}`.

| Drift | Mode | 1k width-2 | 1k recall/quality | 10k width-2 | 10k recall/quality | Notes |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 1% | incremental | 151.48 µs | 7063 bp | 108.06 µs | 3188 bp | Tiny novel clusters can be badly missed at default width before retraining. |
| 1% | rebuilt | 37.70 µs | 3500 bp | 92.06 µs | 10000 bp | At 1k, retraining too early hurts width-2 recall; at 10k it restores recall and lowers latency. |
| 5% | incremental | 161.46 µs | 8500 bp | 125.89 µs | 7313 bp | Drift becomes visible but still scale-sensitive. |
| 5% | rebuilt | 39.11 µs | 6000 bp | 90.99 µs | 10000 bp | 10k has enough novel mass for rebuild to be clearly useful. |
| 10% | incremental | 176.51 µs | 9563 bp | 150.12 µs | 8250 bp | Matches the original 10% drift signal: default width is degraded before retrain. |
| 10% | rebuilt | 38.23 µs | 10000 bp | 121.81 µs | 10000 bp | Rebuild restores default-width recall once the novel cluster is large enough. |

Width-64 guardrail rows still recover recall without rebuild, but they are much
slower than width-2 on the same fixture: 1k ranges from ~357-400 µs incremental
and ~342-370 µs rebuilt; 10k ranges from ~2.38-3.26 ms incremental and
~2.35-3.13 ms rebuilt. This supports a measured retrain policy over simply
raising IVF's default probe width under the 60% read / 40% write workload.

## §3 selene-graph — write pipeline & concurrency

Bench bins: `write_txn_lifecycle`, `provider_fanout`, `bound_type_validation`,
`concurrent_writers`, `graph_hub_delete`, `graph_delete_reclamation`,
`graph_read_under_write`, `graph_mixed_workload`.

### §3a Write-pipeline microbenches

`write_txn_lifecycle` create/delete rows below show the **batch axis at the 100k
fixture** (the headline scale); `empty_commit` shows the scale axis.

The `graph_clone` / `begin_rollback` rows are commit-floor attribution
instruments: the committer handoff has no direct row (`seal` is
crate-private), so derive it as `empty_commit − graph_clone −
begin_rollback`. Current B26 attribution was measured with
`scripts/run-benches.sh --profile full --bench write_txn_lifecycle --save-baseline pre`:
same-run `empty_commit` medians were 12.10 / 37.99 / 47.53 µs, giving a
derived handoff of ~11.0 / ~27.5 / ~23.9 µs. A local
drop-relocation probe (`ArcSwap::swap` old snapshot returned through the commit
ack) regressed `empty_commit` to 39.50 µs at 50k (+4.0%) and 50.82 µs at 100k
(+6.9%), so it was rejected rather than landed.

The `indexed_*` rows use a no-edge fixture with a high-cardinality typed key and
populated composite, flat-vector, and text indexes. They isolate index registry
clone cost from adjacency/storage clone cost; current results show index data is
already mostly Arc-backed and does not dominate the commit floor.

### §3b `graph_hub_delete` — high-degree hub deletion (GRAPH-05 ✓ shipped)

Deleting a node cascades over every incident edge. GRAPH-05 made adjacency
removal **in place**: the deleted node's own `adjacency_out`/`adjacency_in`
entries are dropped wholesale (O(1) each) and each incident edge clears only the
neighbor side via `imbl::HashMap::get_mut` — no per-edge full-`SmallVec` clone.
That turned a degree-`D` hub delete from O(D²) to O(D); the curve below is now
linear (10× degree → ~9× time). This sweeps the **degree** axis (not node scale).

| Bench | degree=100 | degree=1000 | degree=10000 | Notes |

### §3c `graph_delete_reclamation` — delete payload clearing and compaction

`graph_delete_reclamation/*` isolates the storage side of deletes from vector
index maintenance. The fixture stores 768-dim `Value::Vector` payloads on
embedding nodes, deletes 10% of nodes, and reports the logical vector payload
cleared at delete time in the Criterion id suffix. Delete clears heavyweight
properties immediately while retaining dead rows for stable id mapping;
`compact_after_vector_delete` then measures row densification and asserts the
`CompactionReport` reclaims those dead rows.

| `graph_delete_reclamation/vector_payload_delete/n1k_del100_dim768_payload300k` | 105.98 µs | Deletes 100 vector-bearing nodes and clears ~300 KiB of vector payload from the per-iteration graph; fixture clone/setup excluded. |

### §3d `graph_read_under_write` — lock-free reads under contention (D10)

Times a fixed read batch (8 threads × 20k = 160k reads) while one background
writer churns commits on the `ArcSwap` snapshot. The D10 promise is that a held
write lock never blocks a reader; a regression that puts reads behind the write
lock collapses this. Dual of `concurrent_writers` (which times the writers).

| Bench | 10k | 50k | 100k | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `graph_read_under_write` | 17.1 ms | 21.5 ms | 24.5 ms | ~107–153 ns/read; rises only with snapshot footprint, not lock contention. |

### §3e `concurrent_writers` — serialized writer queueing under contention

Thread fan-in arms sweep `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32]` (representative `1/8/32` shown).
Two axes:

- **In-memory** (`threads{N}`, `threads{N}_with_readers8`) — no WAL; pure
  single-committer queueing + lock-free reads under contention. Group commit has
  nothing to coalesce here (no `fsync`), so it is not run on this axis.
- **WAL-backed** (`wal_threads{N}_batchOFF` vs `_batchON`) — a real on-disk WAL
  (tempdir per iteration; the committer is the sole `fsync` caller in
  `SyncPolicy::OnFlushOnly`). The only axis where group commit can win, because
  the win is coalesced `fsync` syscalls. `batchOFF` = `CommitBatching::Off` (one
  `fsync`/commit); `batchON` = `CommitBatching::DEFAULT_ON` (coalesce ≤64 commits
  / 8 MiB per `fsync`).

On `full`/`stress`, each WAL-backed arm also prints an **untimed**
`[concurrent_writers percentiles] … p50/p99/p999` line to stderr (the
tail-latency story the mean sample can't show).

| Bench | threads=1 | threads=8 | threads=32 | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `concurrent_writers/threads{N}` | 332 ms | 304 ms | 305 ms | In-memory; 1000 commits, 10 updates each. |
| `concurrent_writers/threads{N}_with_readers8` | 726 ms | 641 ms | 651 ms | Same load + 8 snapshot readers. |
| `concurrent_writers/wal_threads{N}_batchOFF` | 4.71 s | 3.86 s | 3.83 s | Real WAL, one `fsync`/commit. |
| `concurrent_writers/wal_threads{N}_batchON` | 4.57 s | 953 ms | **269 ms** | Group commit — **14× over batchOFF at 32 threads**; ≈ batchOFF at 1 thread (nothing to coalesce). |

## §4 selene-persist — WAL & snapshot

Bench bins: `wal`, `snapshot`, plus `graph_snapshot_roundtrip` (lives in the
`selene-graph` crate but exercises the persist/D14 path end to end).

### §4a WAL

`scale` = WAL entries, not graph nodes. `_no_fsync` rows use
`SyncPolicy::OnFlushOnly` (append/threshold/drop fsync suppressed; a caller
`flush()` would still sync).

| Bench | 10k | 50k | 100k | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `persist_wal_append_single` | 65.2 ms | 322.4 ms | 630.9 ms | Single-entry loop, `EveryN(1000)`. |
| `persist_wal_append_single_no_fsync` | 11.5 ms | 55.7 ms | 111.2 ms | Donor-parity diagnostic, no append fsync. |
| `persist_wal_append_batch_1000` | 6.49 ms | 9.57 ms | 12.58 ms | 1000-change entries — **50× faster than per-entry at 100k**. |
| `persist_wal_append_batch_1000_no_fsync` | 2.04 ms | 5.04 ms | 8.28 ms | Batched, no flush in timed body. |
| `persist_wal_replay` | 4.23 ms | 18.67 ms | 32.27 ms | Fixed-layout header + xxh3 + BufReader. |
| `persist_wal_open_scan` | 161.75 µs | 760.79 µs | 1.5317 ms | Writer reopen validation scan after B16 buffered open-scan. |

#### `persist_wal_open_scan` — writer reopen validation (B16)

Measures `WalWriter::open` over an existing WAL with `scale` single-change
entries. The timed body covers file open/lock, file header read, entry-header
scan, payload checksum validation, and final committed-offset positioning; the
WAL fixture is created outside the timed body.

Commands:

```bash
scripts/run-benches.sh --profile full --bench wal --filter persist_wal_open_scan --save-baseline b16_pre
scripts/run-benches.sh --profile full --bench wal --filter persist_wal_open_scan --baseline b16_pre
```

| Bench | Before | After | Signal |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `persist_wal_open_scan/10000` | 7.9089 ms | 161.75 µs | Buffered sequential scan avoids per-entry seek and reuses the payload buffer; Criterion reported −97.533%. |
| `persist_wal_open_scan/50000` | 43.344 ms | 760.79 µs | Criterion reported −98.083%. |
| `persist_wal_open_scan/100000` | 87.278 ms | 1.5317 ms | Criterion reported −98.083%. |

#### `persist_wal_body_size_no_fsync` — entry-body packing (PERSIST-04)

Fixed total changes (100k), swept changes-per-entry packing — isolates the
per-byte serialize+write cost from the per-entry overhead the count sweeps
cover. Per-entry overhead dominates at small bodies; the minimum is ~10k
changes/entry, after which large-`Vec` build/alloc creeps back in. This was the
PERSIST-04 measurement surface; the stable manual `write_vectored` candidate was
measured-rejected on 2026-06-01 because it regressed the WAL append hot path, so
the contiguous `Vec` + `write_all` path remains the baseline.

| Bench | per-entry=100 | =1000 | =10000 | =50000 | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `persist_wal_body_size_no_fsync` | 12.5 ms | 8.42 ms | 7.22 ms | 13.1 ms | Equal total work; U-shaped in packing; vectored write rejected. |

#### `persist_wal_payload_shape_*` — scalar / JSON / vector payloads

These rows keep the WAL format unchanged and isolate payload shape for the
future WAL/compression overhaul. Quick profile writes/replays 1k changes as ten
100-change entries with `SyncPolicy::OnFlushOnly`; setup is outside the replay
timed body. The JSON fixture models an agent-memory metadata document, and the
vector fixtures use 128-dim and 768-dim first-class `Value::Vector` payloads.

Command:

```bash
scripts/run-benches.sh --profile quick --bench wal --filter payload_shape
```

| Bench | scalar i64 | JSON metadata | vector128 | vector768 | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| `persist_wal_payload_shape_no_fsync` | 1.084 ms | 1.677 ms | 1.826 ms | 2.185 ms | Append path only; no fsync in timed body. |
| `persist_wal_payload_shape_replay` | 1.433 ms | 2.870 ms | 2.514 ms | 2.908 ms | Reader open + checksum + optional decompression + postcard decode. |

#### `persist_wal_payload_compression_sweep` — compression threshold pressure

Benchmark-only codec sweep for the future WAL rewrite. The fixture serializes
`ChangeSet` payloads with `postcard` outside the timed body, then the timed body
applies a candidate compression threshold, optionally runs zstd level 1, and
computes the xxh3 checksum over the bytes that would be framed in the WAL. This
does not write to disk and does not measure fsync.

Command:

```bash
scripts/run-benches.sh --profile quick --bench wal --filter persist_wal_payload_compression_sweep
```

Quick profile on 2026-06-06 before the default threshold was raised to 4096
bytes. `current128` was the production `COMPRESS_THRESHOLD` at measurement
time; `never` is checksum-only. `always` mostly confirms the cost of
compressing sub-threshold bodies, so the table keeps representative threshold
rows and calls out sub-threshold compression in the notes.

| Payload | batch | current128 | 512 | 4096 | never | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| scalar i64 | 1 | 2.23 ns | 2.23 ns | 2.23 ns | 2.23 ns | `always` compressed the tiny body at 1.19 us. |
| scalar i64 | 10 | 1.19 us | 10.1 ns | 10.1 ns | 10.1 ns | 512 avoids compression that current128 takes. |
| scalar i64 | 100 | 5.99 us | 6.01 us | 6.00 us | 96.4 ns | Crosses all swept thresholds below `never`. |
| JSON metadata | 1 | 3.87 us | 6.63 ns | 6.63 ns | 6.62 ns | Single JSON record crosses current128 only. |
| JSON metadata | 10 | 4.91 us | 4.91 us | 51.0 ns | 51.0 ns | 4096 avoids compression for this batch. |
| JSON metadata | 100 | 15.1 us | 14.9 us | 14.8 us | 552 ns | Crosses all swept thresholds below `never`. |
| vector128 | 1 | 4.92 us | 4.91 us | 11.3 ns | 11.3 ns | 4096 avoids single-vector compression. |
| vector128 | 10 | 9.86 us | 9.87 us | 9.89 us | 113 ns | Crosses all swept thresholds below `never`. |
| vector128 | 100 | 21.4 us | 21.4 us | 21.5 us | 1.18 us | Checksum-only cost rises with body size. |
| vector768 | 1 | 7.48 us | 7.50 us | 62.3 ns | 62.3 ns | 4096 avoids single-vector compression. |
| vector768 | 10 | 13.8 us | 13.8 us | 13.8 us | 654 ns | Crosses all swept thresholds below `never`. |
| vector768 | 100 | 35.6 us | 35.7 us | 35.7 us | 6.59 us | Large vector batches dominate checksum too. |

Decision signal: the existing 128-byte threshold is aggressive for scalar,
single JSON, and single-vector entries. Raising the threshold would avoid
microsecond-scale zstd work on many small writes, but this benchmark is only a
codec threshold surface; an actual WAL format or policy change still needs
end-to-end append/replay and recovery evidence.

#### `persist_wal_payload_compression_policy_*` — real writer policy sweep

End-to-end companion to the codec threshold sweep. These rows use the real
`WalWriter::open_with_compression` path added after the codec-only baseline.
Append rows include postcard serialization, policy selection, optional zstd,
header framing, checksum, and file writes with `SyncPolicy::OnFlushOnly`.
Flush rows add one explicit `WalWriter::flush()` durability barrier at the end
of the append cycle and include deterministic WAL file sizes in the row IDs.
Replay rows build a WAL file with the selected policy in setup, then time
reader iteration, checksum, optional decompression, and postcard decode.

Command:

```bash
scripts/run-benches.sh --profile quick --bench wal --filter compression_policy
scripts/run-benches.sh --profile quick --bench wal --filter compression_policy_flush
```

Quick profile on 2026-06-06 before the default threshold was raised to 4096

Decision signal: the follow-up production policy raises the default threshold
from 128 bytes to 4096 bytes. Disabling compression entirely is still not a
clear global win because larger JSON/vector batches save substantial bytes with
similar durability-inclusive latency. Future reruns compare the old policy as
`threshold128` against the new default as `default4096`.

#### `persist_wal_sync_sweep` — sync-policy sweep

Append + explicit `flush()` across sync policies. The fsync-frequent policies
(`every1`/`every10`/`every100`) are bound by `fsync` syscall latency, not
selene-db code, and balloon to tens of seconds at 100k — they are **capped at
≤10k** so a full sweep is not dominated by one durability cell.

### §4b Snapshot

`persist_snapshot_*` measure the SLSN **container** (framing + per-section zstd +
body hash) over synthetic byte payloads. The uncompressed companion rows isolate
raw framing/body-hash cost with `SectionCompression::None`. `scale` drives section
bytes.

### §4c `graph_snapshot_roundtrip` — real rkyv graph encode/decode (D14)

Unlike the synthetic-bytes snapshot bench above, this drives the **real**
`CoreProvider` path over fixture rows: `IndexProvider::write_section` over every
`CORE/*` sub-tag (rkyv archive of `CORE/NODE`+`CORE/EDGE` positional rows, D14),
then a recovery-mode provider + `finish_recovery` (positional placement / id↔row
rebuild). Self-validating: asserts node/edge counts survive the roundtrip once
(untimed) before measuring. `scale` = fixture node count.

### §5a `gql_correlated_subquery` — correlated EXISTS / aggregate VALUE execution (GQLRT-05/B3)

The only read-query **execution** bench in the suite (`expression_eval` is
scalar-only; `write_e2e` is write-only). A correlated subquery is re-evaluated
per outer row and its pattern schema is rebuilt per row (`schema_for_pattern`); a
memoization win (GQLRT-05) would otherwise be invisible. The `count` arm uses a
correlated `VALUE { ... RETURN count(*) }` aggregate because `COUNT { MATCH ... }`
is intentionally rejected by the current parser. In-memory graph (no WAL) so the
timed body is read execution, not durability. Uses a **small scale envelope**
(2.5k/5k/10k fixture rows, ~scale/3 `Person` rows) — correlated
re-evaluation is O(rows × subquery), so the cost grows super-linearly when the
inner scan cannot reuse the already-bound outer entity.

_Refreshed 2026-06-11 for B3 (development post-#705 vs the feature branch on this
M5, profile `full`, mimalloc), so these run ahead of the `3a864ac` header until
the next clean re-sweep. Seed-bound scans short-circuit the inner scan when the
scan binding is already a live `NodeRef`/`EdgeRef` in the outer row, while still
reapplying liveness, labels, value constraints, binding equality, and residual
predicates. Development baselines were: exists 58.951 ms / 237.45 ms / 932.70 ms
and count 59.387 ms / 235.91 ms / 933.92 ms at 2.5k / 5k / 10k. The B3 medians
below are ~90x / 190x / 339x faster for EXISTS and ~85x / 179x / 349x faster for
the aggregate count arm._

_Refreshed again 2026-06-11 for B5 (development post-#706 vs the feature

post-B3 residual lookup cost without changing user-keyed label/property maps._

_Refreshed again 2026-06-11 for B18/B20 (development post-#707 vs the feature
branch, same M5, profile `full`, mimalloc). B18 resolves scan, expand/repeat,
join-key, subplan-projection, and evaluator variable names without per-row
`DbString` clones where the runtime operator can safely hoist the column
indexes. B20 makes per-group aggregate slots borrow the immutable plan
`Aggregate` descriptor instead of cloning it for every group._

### §5b `write_e2e` — GQL write end-to-end

Two families. The **in-memory CPU** family runs on a no-WAL `SharedGraph` to
isolate parse/plan/execute + in-memory commit CPU. The **durable** family
(`*_with_flush`, `direct_*`) keeps a real WAL on `OnFlushOnly` /
`CommitBatching::Off`. The `match_*` / `insert_node_with_edge` arms scan the
fixture and so scale with N; the single-node arms are flat.

### §5c `read_pipeline` — read-query pipeline execution

Read-execution coverage for the declared 60%-read workload: label scan +
indexed range filter, two-leg hash join, ORDER BY top-K, high-cardinality
GROUP BY, DISTINCT dedup, indexed `IN` bitmap union, inline `CALL {}`
table-subquery row extension, correlated `NEXT` row expansion, non-leading
`OPTIONAL MATCH` null-extension, post-RETURN bare `LIMIT 10`, pre-RETURN bare
`LIMIT 10`, and maintained composite-index equality lookup. Warm-plan-cache rows run over
`BenchFixture` on an in-memory `SharedGraph` (no WAL), so the timed body is
pure execution + index access — not parse/plan/optimize, not durability. Cold
and shared-cache companions on the cheapest row rebuild a fresh session per
iteration to isolate short-lived-session cache strategy. The join targets
`Person→Sensor→Device` deliberately: every fixture
`KNOWS` offset is ≡1 mod 3, so a `Person→Person` join would be empty.

_Measured 2026-06-11 on the B3 feature branch (profile `full`, mimalloc), so
these run ahead of the `3a864ac` header until the next clean re-sweep. The
same-session development guard stayed within noise for ordinary read rows; the
50k hashjoin sample printed wide variance (`p = 0.14`, no statistically
significant change), and the seeded-scan branch does not show a persistent
no-seed scan tax._

Historical baseline signals worth reading directly from the table: warm
`match_limit10` is **scale-linear** (784 µs → 13.39 ms for ten output rows) —
the scan does not short-circuit on LIMIT, which is the B19 baseline this row
exists to expose; and `match_limit10/cold` ≈ warm at these scales because the
~30–45 µs fixed compile cost (clearly visible at the 1k quick scale: 111 µs
cold vs 81 µs warm) amortizes under the linear scan.

## §6 selene-algorithms

Bench bins: `algo_bench`, `projection`, `vector_graph_retrieval`. Fixture:
`BenchFixture::build(N)` (≈3N edges) for pagerank/betweenness/apsp and
projection; `planted_community_graph(N)` (≈6N edges, ~N/64 communities) for
triangle_count, WCC/SCC, articulation_points, label_propagation, and louvain;
`dag_graph(N)` (≈3N edges) for pagerank_orientation, dijkstra, SSSP, and
topological_sort.
`vector_graph_retrieval` is the
first native graph+vector agent-memory research fixture: it stores topic-summary
vectors plus support, temporal-validity, and supersession edges to evidence
nodes, then compares vector-only ANN against PageRank rerank, graph expansion,
validity-aware expansion, supersession-aware expansion, and an exact
graph/vector oracle. Row IDs encode total graph coverage as
`covbp{basis points}`, current-valid coverage as `curbp{basis points}`, and
topic precision as `precbp{basis points}`.

### §6b `projection` — CSR foundation (ALGO-01/02/05)

Every algorithm runs *over* a projection, but `algo_bench` builds it in untimed
setup. This isolates the build (graph scan + CSR construction) and the per-edge
neighbor walk — exactly the two numbers the CSR dense-`u32` reshape
(ALGO-01/02/05) changes.

_§6a/§6b medians below are refreshed post-ALGO-01/02/05 (an A/B of development
HEAD vs the feature branch on this M5, profile `full`), so they run ahead of the
`3a864ac` north-star header until the next clean re-sweep. The dense-`u32` cache
trades a one-time **+4–7% `projection_build`** (one extra `u32` write per
neighbor, `ProjNeighbor` 24→32 B) for **−6 to −52%** across every algorithm that
resolved the dense index per edge (pagerank/louvain/apsp/triangle); even raw
`neighbor_iter` dropped −4 to −6%._

### §6c Graph-Augmented Vector Retrieval Research

Quick rows below are local research fixtures, not production API claims. The
fixture intentionally makes top-k vector retrieval semantically redundant:
nearest summaries are high-precision but low-coverage, while one-hop `SUPPORTS`
expansion can recover evidence facts from the graph. Half of evidence nodes are
stale by construction; `VALID_AT` edges identify current evidence, while
`SUPERSEDED_BY` edges link stale evidence to a current replacement. This lets
the fixture separate raw coverage from current-valid coverage, then compare
filtering against graph repair. Uniform and personalized PageRank scores plus
WCC component candidates are computed in fixture setup through real
`GraphProjection` paths; timed rows measure retrieval only. Expanded graph
candidates are exact-scored through the native candidate scoring primitive
before fact-diverse selection. The exact graph oracle uses exact vector search
plus validity-aware graph expansion to bound achievable fixture quality. The
companion `graph_vector_component_pressure` group widens graph-derived component
pools before the same exact candidate scorer, exposing when graph-bounded
scoring stops being cheap enough to beat ANN or compressed pre-scoring.

Opt-in embedding rows are disabled unless `SELENE_EMBEDDING_BENCH=1` (or the
legacy `SELENE_OMLX_EMBEDDING_BENCH=1`) is set. New
`SELENE_EMBEDDING_BENCH=1` runs default to OpenRouter; set
`SELENE_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=omlx` or use the legacy enable flag for the local
oMLX OpenAI-compatible endpoint. These rows are **not** expected to run in CI.
Use ignored `.env` keys only through the shell environment; do not commit or
print them:

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a
SELENE_EMBEDDING_BENCH=1 \
SELENE_EMBEDDING_CORPUS=code_alias_memory \
SELENE_GRAPH_HINT_DOCS_PER_TOPIC=2 \
scripts/run-benches.sh --profile quick --bench procedure_call_repeat --filter query_root_current_state_intersection_batch
```

Local oMLX rows remain available explicitly:

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a
SELENE_EMBEDDING_BENCH=1 \
SELENE_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=omlx \
SELENE_EMBEDDING_CORPUS=tiny \
SELENE_EMBEDDING_MODELS=Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B-4bit-DWQ,Qwen3-Embedding-4B-4bit-DWQ \
scripts/run-benches.sh --profile quick --bench vector_graph_retrieval --filter graph_vector_omlx_embedding_pressure --vector-scales 1000
```

OpenRouter Codestral Embed rows use the same corpora and benchmark surfaces:

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a
SELENE_EMBEDDING_BENCH=1 \
SELENE_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openrouter \
SELENE_EMBEDDING_CORPUS=code_alias_memory \
SELENE_GRAPH_HINT_DOCS_PER_TOPIC=2 \
scripts/run-benches.sh --profile quick --bench procedure_call_repeat --filter query_root_current_state_intersection_batch
```

The reverse-order Codestral text/vector row compares vector-expanded candidates
followed by BM25 over those explicit candidates:

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a
SELENE_EMBEDDING_BENCH=1 \
SELENE_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openrouter \
SELENE_EMBEDDING_CORPUS=code_alias_memory \
SELENE_GRAPH_HINT_DOCS_PER_TOPIC=2 \
scripts/run-benches.sh --profile quick --bench procedure_call_repeat \
  --filter 'query_root_vector_text_batch|query_root_current_state_text_score_batch|query_root_current_state_intersection_batch|query_root_expansion_batch'
```

In that comparison run, the companion medians were 146.35 us for
current-state BM25, 222.94 us for current-state vector scoring, and 224.65 us
for plain graph-expanded vector scoring.

The wider 16-query code/alias profile uses the same benchmark row family:

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a
SELENE_EMBEDDING_BENCH=1 \
SELENE_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openrouter \
SELENE_EMBEDDING_CORPUS=code_alias_wide_memory \
SELENE_GRAPH_HINT_DOCS_PER_TOPIC=2 \

  --filter 'query_root_current_state_text_score_batch|query_root_current_state_text_vector_batch|query_root_current_state_intersection_batch|query_root_provenance_state_intersection_batch|query_root_expansion_batch|query_root_vector_text_batch'
```

The project-code profile uses curated source-shaped snippets with real
selene-db module and symbol names:

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a
SELENE_EMBEDDING_BENCH=1 \
SELENE_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openrouter \
SELENE_EMBEDDING_CORPUS=project_code_memory \
SELENE_GRAPH_HINT_DOCS_PER_TOPIC=2 \
scripts/run-benches.sh --profile quick --bench procedure_call_repeat \
  --filter 'query_root_current_state_text_score_batch|query_root_current_state_text_vector_batch|query_root_current_state_intersection_batch|query_root_provenance_state_intersection_batch|query_root_expansion_batch|query_root_vector_text_batch'
```

The project-code alias profile keeps real module/symbol names but adds
natural-language decoys around the same concepts:

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a
SELENE_EMBEDDING_BENCH=1 \
SELENE_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openrouter \
SELENE_EMBEDDING_CORPUS=project_code_alias_memory \
SELENE_GRAPH_HINT_DOCS_PER_TOPIC=2 \
scripts/run-benches.sh --profile quick --bench procedure_call_repeat \
  --filter 'query_root_current_state_text_score_batch|query_root_current_state_text_vector_batch|query_root_current_state_intersection_batch|query_root_provenance_state_intersection_batch|query_root_expansion_batch|query_root_vector_text_batch'
```

The project source-code profile uses short real selene-db source excerpts as
target documents, plus source-shaped distractors and currentness decoys:

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a
SELENE_EMBEDDING_BENCH=1 \
SELENE_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openrouter \
SELENE_EMBEDDING_CORPUS=project_source_code_memory \
SELENE_GRAPH_HINT_DOCS_PER_TOPIC=2 \
scripts/run-benches.sh --profile quick --bench procedure_call_repeat \
  --filter 'query_root_current_state_text_score_batch|query_root_current_state_text_vector_batch|query_root_current_state_intersection_batch|query_root_provenance_state_intersection_batch|query_root_expansion_batch|query_root_vector_text_batch'
```

The project source-chunk profile uses target-aware implementation snippets from
current selene-db modules. The first two documents per topic are non-target
graph-root hints, so `SELENE_GRAPH_HINT_DOCS_PER_TOPIC=2` keeps targets in the
expanded support set:

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a
SELENE_EMBEDDING_BENCH=1 \
SELENE_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openrouter \
SELENE_EMBEDDING_CORPUS=project_source_chunk_memory \
SELENE_EMBEDDING_BATCH_SIZE=4 \
SELENE_GRAPH_HINT_DOCS_PER_TOPIC=2 \
scripts/run-benches.sh --profile quick --bench procedure_call_repeat \
  --filter 'query_root_current_state_text_score_batch|query_root_current_state_text_vector_batch|query_root_current_state_intersection_batch|query_root_provenance_state_intersection_batch|query_root_expansion_batch|query_root_vector_text_batch'
```

The project source-file profile embeds selected real selene-db files as
file-level documents. Use a smaller setup batch size for external providers so
full-file inputs are sent in conservative chunks:

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a
SELENE_EMBEDDING_BENCH=1 \
SELENE_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openrouter \
SELENE_EMBEDDING_CORPUS=project_source_file_memory \
SELENE_EMBEDDING_BATCH_SIZE=4 \
SELENE_GRAPH_HINT_DOCS_PER_TOPIC=2 \
scripts/run-benches.sh --profile quick --bench procedure_call_repeat \
  --filter 'query_root_current_state_text_score_batch|query_root_current_state_text_vector_batch|query_root_current_state_intersection_batch|query_root_provenance_state_intersection_batch|query_root_expansion_batch|query_root_vector_text_batch'
```

The project migration profile uses archived/prototype terminology as query
aliases, current first-class engine surfaces as target documents, and stale
decoy documents that maintained current-state should exclude:

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a
SELENE_EMBEDDING_BENCH=1 \
SELENE_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openrouter \
SELENE_EMBEDDING_CORPUS=project_migration_memory \
SELENE_GRAPH_HINT_DOCS_PER_TOPIC=2 \
scripts/run-benches.sh --profile quick --bench procedure_call_repeat \
  --filter 'query_root_current_state_text_score_batch|query_root_current_state_text_vector_batch|query_root_current_state_intersection_batch|query_root_provenance_state_intersection_batch|query_root_expansion_batch|query_root_vector_text_batch'
```

The GQL query-root rows use the same local oMLX corpus but exercise the full
query pipeline. The materialization rows isolate `MATCH` plus
`WITH collect_list(root)` root production before any vector procedure runs; the
shape-pressure rows split that further into anchor lookup, root-row traversal,
and root-list aggregation. The reused-session rows compare root-only and
full-scoring shapes against a long-lived session with and without the existing
source-string `PlanCache`: plan caching collapses repeated root-only query
production, while full scoring is effectively neutral because vector rerank is
the dominant work. The scoring row derives `OmlxDependsOn` graph-hint roots,
passes them into `selene.vector_score_expanded_candidates`, and the procedure
expands roots through `OmlxSupports` before exact scoring. Its maintained-state
companion uses the same GQL-produced roots with
`selene.vector_score_candidate_state_expanded`, intersecting expanded roots
with the provider-maintained `omlx_support_facts` set. The negative-evidence
state row uses the same procedure over `omlx_current_support_facts`, where
documents containing stale/superseded/contradictory wording have an outgoing
`OmlxNegativeEvidence` edge and are excluded from current support state. The
provenance-required row uses `omlx_provenance_current_support_facts`, adding a
required incoming `OmlxSupports` edge and required outgoing `OmlxGroundedBy`
edge before the same exact rerank. The text-score rows use the same
GQL-produced roots, expand them through `OmlxSupports` in GQL, then call
`selene.text_score_nodes` over explicit candidate nodes using a maintained BM25
text index. The batched rows store each query vector and query text on the query
anchor and let GQL aggregate per-query root/candidate sets. The text batch row
calls `selene.text_score_nodes_batch` once for the full 16-query profile after
GQL expands graph roots to explicit candidates. The current-state text batch row
calls `selene.text_score_candidate_state_expanded_batch` once for the same
profile, keeping maintained-state composition, graph expansion, and BM25
scoring inside one procedure boundary. The text/vector fusion row uses the same
current-state BM25 batch row as a candidate producer, regroups its hits, and
then calls `selene.vector_score_nodes_batch` for exact vector rerank. The pure
expansion row calls `selene.vector_score_expanded_candidates_batch` once for the
full 16-query profile; the current/provenance vector rows call
`selene.vector_score_candidate_state_expanded_batch` so maintained state,
graph-expanded roots, and exact rerank stay inside one procedure boundary:

```bash
SELENE_EMBEDDING_BENCH=1 \
SELENE_EMBEDDING_CORPUS=scaled_ambiguous_memory \
SELENE_GRAPH_HINT_DOCS_PER_TOPIC=2 \
scripts/run-benches.sh --profile quick --bench procedure_call_repeat --filter procedure_vector_omlx_query_roots
```

Embedding requests are chunked by `SELENE_EMBEDDING_BATCH_SIZE` (or legacy
`SELENE_OMLX_EMBEDDING_BATCH_SIZE`; default: 64). Profiles above that size
preserve input order across multiple POSTs and fail if any response chunk does
not return exactly one vector per input.
`SELENE_EMBEDDING_CORPUS_REPEAT=N` (or legacy
`SELENE_OMLX_CORPUS_REPEAT=N`) repeats document inputs while keeping one copy
of each query. Duplicate documents keep their topic but clear target keys and
append a short duplicate marker to the submitted text, so target-hit rows keep a
unique original target document while index-pressure rows can grow a source
corpus beyond the default TurboQuant `c512` envelope.
`SELENE_GRAPH_HINT_DOCS_PER_TOPIC=N` caps graph-authored topic labels and
`OmlxDependsOn` edges to the first `N` same-topic documents per topic; unset
means every same-topic document receives graph hints. The partial-hint fixture
also adds `OmlxSupports` edges from graph-hint documents to same-topic support
facts so rows can compare direct partial hints, graph-expanded hints, and ANN
union against the same endpoint embeddings.
The fixture also registers a maintained candidate-state provider named
`omlx_support_facts` over an explicit `OmlxSupportFact` label, plus
`omlx_current_support_facts` over the same label with outgoing
`OmlxNegativeEvidence` edges as exclusions, and
`omlx_provenance_current_support_facts` over the same current-state rules plus
required incoming support and outgoing provenance edges. With partial graph
hints, graph-hint roots are not support facts; with uncapped hints, every
document remains a support fact. That models provider-maintained support facts
separately from graph-hint root documents without making the default uncapped
profile degenerate to an empty state. `curbp{basis points}` records current
support precision, while `basecurbp` records the direct graph-expanded row's
current precision before negative-evidence filtering. Target-aware local
profiles also add `hitbp{basis points}`, which records how many queries had
their expected target document in the returned top-k set.

The first local corpus is intentionally tiny (16 documents + 4 queries across
GQL, vector-index, agent-memory, and Rust-code topics). It validates that real
endpoint embeddings round-trip through `Value::Vector`, graph HNSW indexing,
exact cosine search, ANN search, and graph-label candidate-set scoring before
larger local corpus work. `SELENE_OMLX_CORPUS=agent_memory` expands that to
32 documents + 8 queries; `SELENE_OMLX_CORPUS=ambiguous_memory` keeps the same
shape but deliberately overlaps vocabulary across topics to stress vector-only
retrieval. `SELENE_OMLX_CORPUS=scaled_ambiguous_memory` combines both 40-input
profiles into 64 documents + 16 queries, crossing the default batch size as a
64+16 request pair. `SELENE_OMLX_CORPUS=code_alias_memory` adds a smaller
target-aware code/alias profile; `SELENE_OMLX_CORPUS=code_alias_wide_memory`
extends that shape to 16 target queries.
`SELENE_OMLX_CORPUS=project_code_memory`,
`project_code_alias_memory`, `project_source_code_memory`,
`project_source_chunk_memory`, and `project_source_file_memory` use current
selene-db module names, implementation snippets, or selected full files to
stress code/source retrieval. `project_workspace_source_memory` reads the
current checkout at benchmark setup time and extracts small line-numbered
windows around named source symbols, so it can feed live project code into
local embedding rows without committing more stale snippets.
`project_migration_memory` uses stale archived/prototype wording as query and
decoy pressure while targeting current engine files and procedures. These
target-aware profiles keep topic/current precision metrics but also record
`hitbp` so rows can show whether the expected symbol/fact/file was retrieved,
not only whether the result was in the right broad topic:

Current vector-index and retrieval policy matrix from the evidence above:

| Workload shape | Prefer | Evidence and caveats |
|---|---|---|
| Tiny or small full-label vector search, especially when `k`/search width covers the index | Exact scan or flat/exact index; HNSW only when approximate quality is acceptable | On live Codestral source chunks, the 32-document row has exact at 149.51 µs, HNSW at 137.90 µs, and TurboQuant after exact-covered bypass at 150.88 µs. At 544 documents, exact remains faster than TurboQuant (2.4743 ms vs 3.6629 ms) while preserving the same `precbp9218`. |
| Broad high-dimensional cosine search where topic-level quality matters and corpus size is comfortably beyond c512 | IVF when the live/clustered quality suffix holds; `TurboQuantCosine` when compressed exact-rerank state is the reason to build the index | The same-run 2k live Codestral source-chunk row has default IVF p2 at 393.62 µs with `precbp9218`, versus TurboQuant c512 at 6.4123 ms and exact at 9.4456 ms with the same topic suffix. Target-hit is much weaker (`hitbp5000` for IVF/HNSW, `hitbp5625` for exact/TurboQuant), so broad index-only search is not target-complete on this repeated target-aware corpus. `selene.create_vector_index(label, property, dimension)` therefore defaults to `ivf_cosine` for omitted kind; explicit `turbo_quant` remains the compressed exact-rerank path. |
| Lowest-latency approximate vector lookup where recall/precision loss is acceptable or can be repaired by a later exact/state stage | HNSW | The 2k Codestral row has HNSW ef64 at 918.94 µs, much faster than exact/TurboQuant, but with lower `precbp8593`. HNSW remains the latency-oriented ANN primitive; use exact rerank, graph/state gating, or wider/tuned settings when quality matters. |
| Coarse partitioning, cheap rebuild/recommended maintenance, clustered source corpora, or explicit list-count experiments | IVF | IVF rebuild and recommended-rebuild rows are cheap relative to HNSW construction (`ivf_cos_dim128` 2.124 ms at 1k, recommended 12.63 ms at 10k). The 2k live Codestral row now also gives IVF p2 the best latency while preserving the exact topic-precision suffix. This promotes IVF for the omitted native vector-index kind and clustered/source-shaped broad candidate generation, but its `hitbp5000` result means target-specific retrieval should still prefer graph/state/BM25 roots when available. |
| Tight graph-derived, maintained-state, BM25, JSON, or explicit candidate sets | Exact graph-candidate scoring or maintained candidate-state scoring | Candidate/state rows are microsecond-scale for c32-c128, and live source/code rows show graph-expanded current-state vector scoring around 300 µs with full target/current precision where applicable. This remains the default for agent-memory and source-shaped workflows when graph or text can produce a meaningful candidate set. |
| Lexical/currentness-rooted retrieval where BM25 already finds the target set | Maintained BM25/current-state, optionally followed by exact vector rerank or RRF only when it closes a measured quality gap | Live OpenRouter source/code rows repeatedly show BM25/current-state as fastest (roughly 170-195 µs on q16 source-shaped profiles) and often target-complete. Text/vector fusion usually preserves quality while adding millisecond-scale vector cost; vector-first BM25 often lowers current precision. RRF can restore full precision/currentness on alias-heavy rows, but the measured composition is slower than the best single maintained-state quality primitive, so it remains an A/B tool rather than a default fused policy. Snapshot-shared text-index state cuts body-update-heavy mixed rows by more than half at 10k/100k; bulk builder append recovers part of the rebuild/regeneration tax. Keep rebuild/recovery scheduling evidence in scope before broadening maintained text/JSON surfaces. |
| Partial graph roots/hints without support expansion or maintained state | Expand/intersect roots before final scoring; do not use raw partial hints as final retrieval | Partial graph-hint rows with `*_GRAPH_HINT_DOCS_PER_TOPIC=2` yield only `c2` and `precbp5000` for raw topic-label candidate scoring. Existing graph-expanded and maintained-state rows recover full topic/current precision by expanding roots through support edges and intersecting state before exact rerank. |

Current hybrid retrieval and maintenance stock-take (2026-06-13):

Confirmed defaults:

- Omitted native vector-index creation now defaults to `ivf_cosine`; exact scan or
  flat/exact remains the small/full-label oracle, HNSW remains the lowest-latency
  approximate path when recall loss is acceptable, and explicit
  `TurboQuantCosine` remains compressed derived state with exact primary-vector
  rerank rather than a blanket default.
- Target-aware source and memory retrieval should start from graph-derived roots,
  maintained candidate state, or maintained BM25 when those producers are
  target-complete. Live OpenRouter Codestral rows keep maintained BM25/current
  state around 170-195 µs on q16 source-shaped profiles, while maintained
  current-state vector scoring is the quality path when lexical candidates miss
  alias-heavy targets.
- JSON exact candidate procedures are correctness oracles and exact metadata
  filters. On the OpenRouter source-chunk row, JSON-current vector scoring kept
  full target/current quality but cost 1.1045 ms versus 318.39 µs for maintained
  current-state vector scoring; JSON-current BM25 cost 364.84 µs versus
  185.29 µs for maintained-state BM25.
- RRF over maintained BM25/current-state and maintained vector/current-state is
  a benchmarked A/B repair tool, not a default fused API. It restored full
  quality on the alias and source-chunk rows, but cost 534.14 µs and 487.45 µs
  respectively, slower than choosing the best single maintained-state primitive.
- Maintained BM25 read paths remain production-relevant, but maintenance
  scheduling matters. Snapshot-shared text-index state cut 100k mixed
  read/update cycles from 764.43 ms to 335.88 ms and write-only text updates
  from 495.04 ms to 62.795 ms; append-based bulk rebuild then cut 100k
  registration from 59.798 ms to 49.751 ms and 100k delete/compact rebuild from
  78.225 ms to 69.793 ms.

Benchmark-backed recommendations:

- Prefer maintained graph state plus the scoring primitive that wins the corpus:
  BM25/current-state for target-complete lexical/source rows, current-state
  vector scoring for alias or stale-decoy rows where lexical candidates miss,
  and exact graph-candidate scoring for tight root sets.
- Keep vector-first BM25, BM25-then-vector rerank, and RRF as benchmark
  compositions until a row shows a quality win that is not available by choosing
  the better existing primitive.
- Use candidate-scoped JSON filters when metadata expresses a required
  predicate or acts as an oracle; do not replace maintained current/support
  state with exact JSON scans when the maintained state already expresses the
  same set.
- Treat text-body churn and rebuild/recovery as the next maintenance pressure
  area before adding broader maintained text or JSON surfaces. The query path is
  cheap (`prebuilt_topic_query/n1000_k10` stayed at 36.528 µs), while 100k
  rebuild/compaction rows remain tens of milliseconds.
- Use OpenRouter live embedding endpoints for future real-validation rows:
  `mistralai/codestral-embed-2505` for code/source-shaped corpora and
  `google/gemini-embedding-2` for general memory/retrieval rows. Local oMLX rows
  are legacy comparison or explicit opt-in rows.

Rejected paths:

- Do not promote `TurboQuantCosine` as the default omitted index kind; the 2k
  OpenRouter source-chunk row made IVF faster at the same topic precision, while
  target-hit quality still required graph/state/text composition.
- Do not add a fused vector-first text API from the current evidence.
  Vector-first BM25 often lowered `precbp`/`curbp` and stayed slower than either
  BM25/current-state or current-state vector scoring.
- Do not make BM25-then-vector rerank a default repair path when the BM25
  candidate producer already missed the target; reranking cannot recover
  documents that never entered the candidate set and adds millisecond-scale
  exact-vector cost on 1536-dimensional OpenRouter rows.
- Do not use JSON-current scans as the default currentness mechanism when
  maintained current/support state is available and equivalent.
- Do not revive raw partial graph hints, ANN unions over precise graph-expanded
  sets, PageRank/Louvain-only candidate roots, postings-only text-index sharing,
  or `Arc<Vec<String>>` document-term sharing as defaults; each has measured
  quality or maintenance regressions in the rows above.

Remaining uncertainty:

- BM25 analyzer quality and sparse lexical-hit behavior still decide whether
  BM25 is merely the fastest root or a target-complete root on harder alias
  corpora.
- Durable JSON/path indexes are not justified yet; they need a focused design
  with recovery, migration, invalidation, and benchmark evidence showing exact
  JSON candidate scans are the bottleneck or quality-critical root.
- Text-index rebuild/recovery under real WAL/snapshot rotation is not fully
  characterized. The current rows isolate graph-side rebuild/compaction cost, not
  an end-to-end durable maintenance cycle.
- Mixed 60/40 maintenance with WAL durability plus maintained BM25, vector
  indexes, candidate states, and JSON metadata still needs a product-shaped row
  before broader storage or scheduling changes.

Next specific benchmark/design input:

- Add a WAL-backed 60/40 maintenance benchmark that seeds OpenRouter-derived
  source/memory corpora, registers maintained BM25 plus candidate states and a
  vector index, exercises JSON metadata filters, then measures query quality,
  update latency, rebuild/recovery, and compaction scheduling in one durable
  cycle. If that row shows exact JSON filters dominate or provide unique quality,
  follow with a maintained JSON/path index design; otherwise keep JSON exact and
  keep optimizing the text/vector/state maintenance path.

The opt-in `Qwen3-Embedding-8B-4bit-DWQ` local model also works on
`/v1/embeddings` and returns 4096-dimensional vectors. With
`SELENE_OMLX_EMBEDDING_MODELS=Qwen3-Embedding-8B-4bit-DWQ`, the cached
partial-hint expansion row reaches `precbp10000`, `c16`, at 205.26 us on the
same scaled profile, the maintained `omlx_support_facts` state row reaches
`precbp10000`, `c14`, at 184.50 us, and the ANN-root maintained-state row only
reaches `precbp5625`, `c42`, at 1.113 ms. The full GQL query-root expansion row
looks up anchors at 477.65 us repeated / 38.66 us hot-plan-cache / 40.96 us
batched, returns root rows at 568.42 us repeated / 54.44 us batched,
materializes roots at 708.65 us repeated / 52.94 us hot-plan-cache / 65.45 us
batched, reaches `precbp10000`, `r2`, `c16`, at 1.39 ms repeated and 1.38 ms
hot-plan-cache but only `basecurbp8437`, the GQL maintained-state intersection
row reaches `precbp10000`, `r2`, `c14`, at 1.47 ms repeated and 1.48 ms
hot-plan-cache, the negative-evidence current-state row reaches `curbp10000`,
`r2`, `c13`, at 1.47 ms repeated and 1.46 ms hot-plan-cache, and the GQL
batched text-score row reaches `precbp10000` / `curbp9218`, `r2`, `c16`, at
476.29 us. The GQL current-state BM25 expanded batch row reaches
`precbp10000` / `curbp10000`, `r2`, `c13`, at 185.55 us. Adding vector rerank
after that BM25 current-state candidate pass keeps the same quality but costs
8.6352 ms, so the GQL batched expansion row at `precbp10000`, `r2`, `c16`, and
660.94 µs remains a better vector path. On the target-aware
`code_alias_memory` profile, current-state BM25 batch reaches `hitbp8750` at
135.41 us, while adding vector rerank keeps the same `hitbp8750` and costs
1.5738 ms. The plain graph-expanded vector batch reaches `precbp10000` and
`hitbp8750`, `r2`, `c9`, at 336.08 us; the maintained vector current-state
batch row reaches `hitbp10000`, `basecurbp8125` / `curbp10000`, `r2`, `c6`, at
345.56 us, making maintained current-state composition the better
target-quality path for that code/alias profile. The vector
batched current-state row reaches `curbp10000`, `r2`, `c13`, at 719.86 µs, and
the batched provenance-state row reaches the same
`curbp10000` / `c13` shape at 707.24 µs. The conservative cached r60/w40 mixed
cycle is 12.52 ms on the same 4096-dimensional row. It stays opt-in for now so
default local oMLX rows remain short and comparable to the earlier two-model
baseline.

OpenRouter `mistralai/codestral-embed-2505` is available through
`SELENE_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openrouter` and returns 1536-dimensional vectors. On
the same target-aware `code_alias_memory` profile, the plain graph-expanded
batch row reaches `precbp10000` / `hitbp8750`, `r2`, `c9`, at 211.05 us, while
the maintained current-state vector batch reaches `hitbp10000`,
`basecurbp7812` / `curbp10000`, `r2`, `c6`, at 211.95 us. Provenance-gated
current-state scoring keeps the same target quality at 212.38 us. Maintained
BM25 over the same graph-expanded current set is faster at 136.79 us but still
misses one expected code/alias target, and vector rerank after that BM25 pass
does not improve target hits while costing 706.33 us. The reverse order,
vector-expanded top-k followed by BM25 over explicit candidates, reaches only
`precbp6562` / `curbp5312` / `hitbp8750` at 327.96 us. This keeps the
current-state conclusion intact for the code-specialized embedding model:
state composition, not model choice alone, recovers the missing target; BM25 is
the fast lexical path only when its candidate producer is target-complete, and
vector-first BM25 pruning is not a win on this corpus.

On the wider `code_alias_wide_memory` profile, target-hit splits further:
current-state BM25 and current-state vector rows find 14 of 16 targets
(`hitbp8750`), while plain vector expansion and vector-first BM25 find 15 of 16
(`hitbp9375`). That extra target comes with a currentness/precision tradeoff:
vector-first BM25 falls to `precbp7031` / `curbp5781` and costs 522.62 us, so
the better follow-up is richer graph state/corpus analysis rather than a fused
procedure.

On the `project_code_memory` profile, all measured Codestral paths find all 16
expected source-shaped targets. BM25/current-state is the fastest path
(`precbp9531` / `curbp9531` / `hitbp10000`, 170.50 us), while current-state
vector scoring restores full broad/current precision at 306.32 us. Vector-first
BM25 keeps `hitbp10000`, but drops to `precbp8750` / `curbp8750` and costs
486.06 us, so it remains a negative default-fusion result even on a corpus where
vector roots are target-complete.

On the harder `project_code_alias_memory` profile, lexical decoys create the
target-quality gap the positive control lacked. BM25/current-state is still
fastest but finds 15 of 16 targets (`hitbp9375`, 170.28 us), and vector rerank
after those BM25 candidates cannot recover the missing target. Current-state
vector scoring reaches `hitbp10000` and `curbp10000` at 314.32 us, making it
the quality path for this source-alias fixture. Vector-first BM25 stays
negative: `hitbp8750`, `curbp8593`, and 495.39 us.

On the `project_source_code_memory` profile, short real source excerpts make
BM25/current-state target-complete again (`hitbp10000`, 195.52 us), so this
acts as a source-file positive control rather than another lexical-failure
case. Maintained current-state vector scoring is also target-complete and
restores `curbp10000` at 328.21 us, while plain graph-expanded vector and
vector-first BM25 both miss one target (`hitbp9375`). The conclusion remains
compositional: use maintained graph state plus the scoring primitive that wins
the corpus, and do not add a fused vector-first BM25 API from these rows.

On the `project_source_chunk_memory` profile, target-aware implementation
snippets keep all measured paths target-complete after the graph-root layout is
kept target-free. BM25/current-state is still fastest (`hitbp10000`,
193.15 us) but has one broad/current miss. Current-state vector scoring
restores `curbp10000` at 328.45 us. Vector-first BM25 is also target-complete
and improves broad precision (`precbp9843`) over BM25/current-state, but it
costs 523.56 us and remains below current-state vector on current precision.
This is useful A/B evidence for chunked code retrieval, not a reason to add a
fused vector-first text API.

On the `project_source_file_memory` profile, selected real project files are
embedded as whole file-level documents. BM25/current-state remains the fastest
target-complete path (`hitbp10000`, 142.50 us) with one broad/current miss.
Current-state vector scoring restores full broad/current precision at
212.75 us. Vector-first BM25 also reaches full target/current precision here
(`hitbp10000`, 318.20 us), which makes this the first positive quality row for
that reverse order, but it is still slower than current-state vector scoring
and much slower than BM25/current-state. Keep it as evidence for corpus-shaped
A/B testing, not production API promotion.

On the `project_migration_memory` profile, queries use archived/prototype
terminology while current target documents cite first-class engine surfaces and
stale decoys model old-code drift. BM25/current-state is still fastest and
target-complete (`hitbp10000`, 170.21 us), but has one broad/current miss.
Current-state vector scoring restores full current precision at 295.29 us, and
vector-first BM25 is target-complete but current-imprecise
(`curbp8125`, 493.91 us). This reinforces graph-maintained current state as the
right correction for old-code drift; vector-first text remains a benchmarked
composition choice, not a default API.

The locally listed `jina-code-embeddings-1.5b-mlx` model is not currently
available from `/v1/embeddings` in oMLX; the endpoint returns HTTP 400 and
reports it as an LLM model for `/v1/chat/completions`, so it is not part of
these rows until it is exposed as an embedding model.

Component-pressure rows pool the query component with additional graph
components before exact vector scoring. Quality remains perfect on this clean
fixture, so these rows isolate candidate-set size pressure rather than topology
noise:

| Component pool | 1k requested / 992 actual | 10k requested / 9,728 actual | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `graph_vector_component_pressure/component_pool_w1/...c16_covbp10000_curbp10000_precbp10000` | 53.0 µs | 116.3 µs | Scores only the query anchor's compact component; this is the same primitive direction as WCC component filtering. |
| `graph_vector_component_pressure/component_pool_w4/...c64_covbp10000_curbp10000_precbp10000` | 183.4 µs | 466.8 µs | Four pooled components still beat broad graph expansion at 10k while keeping oracle quality. |
| `graph_vector_component_pressure/component_pool_w16/...c256_covbp10000_curbp10000_precbp10000` | 685.6 µs | 1.550 ms | Candidate scoring remains linear and predictable, but it is now in the same range as wide graph expansion. |
| `graph_vector_component_pressure/component_pool_w64/...covbp10000_curbp10000_precbp10000` | 2.689 ms (`w62`, `c992`) | 5.691 ms (`c976`) | Near-global pooled scoring is still exact and high quality, but too expensive for the default graph-filtered path; this is the fallback point for ANN or compressed pre-scoring research. |

Topology-pressure rows add cross-topic `SUPPORTS` noise before WCC projection,
then compare the broadened WCC component against a hard topic/session-style
candidate filter. Quality remains perfect because exact vector scoring can
still recover the right topic, so this isolates topology noise as candidate-set
inflation:

| Strategy | 1k requested / 992 actual | 10k requested / 9,728 actual | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `graph_vector_topology_pressure/noisy_wcc/...covbp10000_curbp10000_precbp10000` | 2.535 ms (`c992`) | 56.68 ms (`c9728`) | Cross-topic topology noise collapses WCC into a near-global candidate set; exact scoring preserves quality but is far too expensive. |
| `graph_vector_topology_pressure/topic_filter/...covbp10000_curbp10000_precbp10000` | 102.7 µs (`c32`) | 1.109 ms (`c152`) | A hard topic/session candidate set restores bounded exact scoring under the same noisy graph, pointing toward query-derived subgraph filters before ANN/PQ fallback. |

Community-pressure rows compare algorithm-derived community partitions against
the same noisy topology. These rows are benchmark-only and intentionally use the
same exact vector scorer/fact-diverse selector, so they isolate partition
quality rather than rerank behavior:

| Strategy | 1k requested / 992 actual | 10k requested / 9,728 actual | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `graph_vector_community_pressure/noisy_wcc/...covbp10000_curbp10000_precbp10000` | 2.534 ms (`c992`) | 56.11 ms (`c9728`) | Same broad WCC baseline as topology pressure; quality is perfect only because exact scoring scans nearly the whole noisy graph. |
| `graph_vector_community_pressure/louvain/...` | 7.08 µs (`c2`, `covbp2500`) | 15.59 µs (`c2`, `covbp1250`) | Single-pass Louvain over this star-like memory topology over-partitions to tiny candidate sets. It is fast, but loses too much coverage to be a useful default partition source here. |
| `graph_vector_community_pressure/label_propagation/...` | 53.34 µs (`c17`, `covbp7661`, `precbp8830`) | 112.0 µs (`c16`, `covbp7578`, `precbp8789`) | Label propagation is a useful middle row: compact and fast, but partial-recall compared with the hard topic/session filter. |
| `graph_vector_community_pressure/topic_filter/...covbp10000_curbp10000_precbp10000` | 102.6 µs (`c32`) | 1.094 ms (`c152`) | The hard topic/session filter remains the full-quality reference under this noisy graph. Next research should derive comparable filters from graph/query structure rather than trusting connectivity alone. |

Query-filter rows replace the metadata-only hard topic candidate set with graph
candidate production. Each memory node links to a scope node via `IN_SCOPE`;
the query path follows the anchor's scope edge, scans incoming scope membership
edges, then exact-scores those graph-derived candidates:

| Strategy | 1k requested / 992 actual | 10k requested / 9,728 actual | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| `graph_vector_query_filter_pressure/noisy_wcc/...covbp10000_curbp10000_precbp10000` | 2.558 ms (`c992`) | 56.61 ms (`c9728`) | Repeats the noisy WCC baseline inside the query-filter fixture. |
| `graph_vector_query_filter_pressure/label_propagation/...` | 54.86 µs (`c17`, `covbp7661`, `precbp8830`) | 114.3 µs (`c16`, `covbp7578`, `precbp8789`) | Label propagation stays compact and partial-recall when compared with graph-derived scope filtering. |
| `graph_vector_query_filter_pressure/graph_scope_filter/...covbp10000_curbp10000_precbp10000` | 111.2 µs (`c32`) | 1.142 ms (`c152`) | Graph-derived scope membership matches hard-topic quality with a small traversal overhead. This is the strongest product-shaped primitive so far: graph/query candidate production plus exact vector scoring. |
| `graph_vector_query_filter_pressure/topic_filter/...covbp10000_curbp10000_precbp10000` | 104.3 µs (`c32`) | 1.102 ms (`c152`) | Metadata hard-topic filtering remains the lower-bound reference for the same candidate set. |
| `graph_vector_query_filter_pressure/graph_scope_candidate_set_batch_score/...covbp10000_curbp10000_precbp10000` | 90.47 µs (`c32`) | 498.1 µs (`c152`) | Canonical `VectorCandidateSet` batch scoring over graph-query output now uses query-level batch parallelism once the batch crosses the distributed-work threshold. |
| `graph_vector_query_filter_pressure/graph_scope_unresolved_current_algebra_batch_score/...covbp10000_curbp10000_precbp10000` | 80.92 µs (`c18`) | 840.4 µs (`c89`) | Composing graph-scope output with the maintained unresolved-current candidate set cuts exact scoring work while preserving full quality. |

The candidate-set rows show the boundary tradeoff: canonical graph-query output
is not faster by itself, but it becomes valuable once it composes with another
maintained graph-derived set. That supports `VectorCandidateSet` as a Rust-side
graph/query/active-set glue primitive before adding narrower procedure surfaces.

Session-filter rows add a coarser graph-derived membership edge. Each memory
node links to an `IN_SESSION` node shared by four topics, modeling task/session
scope that is broader than an exact topic but much narrower than noisy
connectivity. These rows keep the same noisy topology and exact vector scorer.
The `*_current_filter` variants prune stale fixture metadata before scoring,
mirroring a freshness-aware graph candidate producer instead of relying on
post-score current-result selection. The `*_unsuperseded_filter` variants derive
the same current candidate set from graph topology by rejecting nodes with an
outgoing `SUPERSEDED_BY` edge before scoring. The
`*_materialized_current_filter` variants use the same graph-derived current set
materialized once during fixture setup. The `*_provenance_expand` variants then
score only graph-current provenance roots with outgoing `SUPPORTS` edges and use
graph expansion plus `SUPERSEDED_BY` repair to recover current supporting facts.
The `*_k1` variants expand only the nearest provenance root, while the
non-suffixed provenance rows expand four roots:

Sparse-provenance rows use the same scope/session candidate producers, but each
summary provenance root supports only a partition of the topic facts. This
turns provenance root fanout into a measurable quality/latency knob instead of
letting a single nearest root cover the whole support set:

Noisy sparse-provenance rows add current wrong-topic `SUPPORTS` edges before the
same sparse correct support partitions. This tests whether a graph-expansion

Multi-hop provenance rows route half of each summary root's support facts
through `MemoryBridge` nodes. The one-hop row intentionally misses those bridged
facts; the two-hop row follows one more `SUPPORTS` layer:

Noisy multi-hop provenance rows add one current wrong-topic `SUPPORTS` edge
before the same bridged support pattern. This keeps the full correct support
set but tests whether bounded-depth expansion admits off-topic tail evidence:

Noisy sparse multi-hop provenance rows combine sparse correct support,

Active-subgraph composition rows reuse the noisy sparse multi-hop topology and
add `CONTRADICTS` edges to current duplicates. The new unresolved-provenance
rows intentionally intersect session/scope, unresolved-current active set,
provenance roots, two-hop expansion, and unresolved-current selection. That is
too strict on this fixture: it is fast, but loses recall because too few
unresolved roots remain:

Active-subgraph fallback rows test that follow-up directly: run strict
unresolved-provenance first, then fill missing current facts from the
materialized unresolved-current active set. The fallback restores full quality,
but it is slower than scoring the maintained active set directly on this
fixture because it pays both the narrow provenance pass and the broad fallback
scoring pass:

Active-hint rows keep the same noisy sparse multi-hop contradicted fixture, but
add graph-authored `RECENT_IN` windows and direct `DEPENDS_ON` edges. This
models a broad session query that can derive a narrower active subgraph from
task memory topology before exact vector scoring:

Batched active-hint candidate-scoring rows compare repeated scoring, generic
`score_vector_nodes_batch_checked`, canonical `VectorCandidateSet` batch
scoring, sorted candidate-set algebra against the maintained unresolved-current
set, and graph-neighbor batch scoring. This isolates the API-boundary impact
from the candidate producer:

ANN rerank rows use the same active-hint fixture, but start from ANN/search-hit
output. They convert wide ANN hits into `VectorCandidateSet`s, optionally
compose them with graph-maintained unresolved-current or dependency candidates,
then exact-score the resulting sets in one batch:

Broad graph-gate rows use the same active-hint fixture but deliberately start
from the expensive session-level graph candidate set. They compare direct
session scoring, direct unresolved-current session scoring, ANN-only hits,
ANN-intersection gates, and ANN-union fallbacks:

| Bench | 1k requested / 992 actual | 10k requested / 9,728 actual | Notes |

| `graph_vector_ann_broad_graph_gate_pressure/ann_wide_session_intersection_batch_rerank/...` | 280.9 µs (`c16`, `covbp5000`) | 783.5 µs (`c15`, `covbp1562`) | Intersecting 16 ANN hits with the broad session set trims exact scoring but does not improve recall. |
| `graph_vector_ann_broad_graph_gate_pressure/ann_broad_session_intersection_batch_rerank/...` | 538.2 µs (`c34`, full quality) | 1.442 ms (`c62`, `covbp5019`) | A 64-hit ANN gate recovers 1k quality but only reaches half coverage at 10k, roughly tied with direct unresolved-current scoring. |
| `graph_vector_ann_broad_graph_gate_pressure/ann_wide_session_union_batch_rerank/...` | 555.9 µs (`c124`) | 4.006 ms (`c608`) | ANN+session union preserves quality but adds ANN overhead without reducing the broad graph set. |
| `graph_vector_ann_broad_graph_gate_pressure/ann_broad_session_union_batch_rerank/...` | 847.6 µs (`c154`) | 4.466 ms (`c609`) | Wider ANN union is strictly slower than direct session scoring on this fixture. |

Interpretation: broad graph candidates are expensive enough that a gate would
matter, but ANN hit sets still do not contain enough graph-memory facts. The
best native shape remains graph-maintained unresolved-current state or stronger
graph-derived active hints; ANN should not be promoted as a broad-session
candidate gate without a different candidate producer or a much stronger recall
profile.

ANN+partial-graph fallback rows use the query-filter topology where label
propagation is a compact but partial graph-derived candidate producer. They
compare ANN alone, label propagation alone, their candidate-set union, and the
full-quality graph-scope reference:

| `graph_vector_ann_graph_fallback_pressure/label_propagation_candidate_set_batch/...` | 54.89 µs (`c17`, `covbp7661`, `precbp8830`) | 117.8 µs (`c16`, `covbp7578`, `precbp8789`) | Label propagation is fast and compact but partial recall. |
| `graph_vector_ann_graph_fallback_pressure/ann_wide_hit_set_batch_rerank/...` | 265.5 µs (`c16`, `covbp5000`, `precbp10000`) | 624.9 µs (`c16`, `covbp1562`, `precbp9765`) | ANN alone is high precision but too low coverage to repair missing graph facts. |

Interpretation: ANN can help a small partial graph partition at 1k, but this
synthetic 10k fixture is still candidate-producer limited. A cheap graph-scope
candidate set remains the full-quality path; ANN fallback needs a different
workload where graph candidates are broad enough to be expensive but not
already quality-complete.

Adaptive provenance rows use the noisy sparse multi-hop topology and a
benchmark-only quality oracle. The adaptive row scores provenance roots once,
then tries k1 one-hop, k1 two-hop, k4 two-hop, k8 two-hop, and k16 two-hop
until full quality is reached or the ladder is exhausted:

Negative-evidence rows use a graph-authored `CONTRADICTS` edge to mark duplicate
current facts as resolved elsewhere, leaving one unresolved current node per
fact. This measures graph-side candidate pruning before exact vector scoring:

Active-set maintenance rows reuse the negative-evidence fixture and time a
60-read / 40-write cycle. The dynamic row pays graph-edge checks on every read
and no maintained-state work on writes. The materialized row pays maintained
set membership on reads and a balanced 20-remove / 20-insert active-set update
cycle on writes:

(graph node 767). Each optimization has a dedicated bench whose median should
move when it lands; refresh that row + diff against the `northstar` baseline to
confirm the win and guard the surrounding rows against regression.

## Update protocol

1. From a clean, synced `development` on a **quiet machine** (background load
   pollutes medians): `git checkout development && git pull --ff-only`.
2. Run the full sweep, saving the baseline:
   `scripts/run-benches.sh --profile full --save-baseline northstar`.
3. Refresh the header: `_Last measured_` date + hardware footprint (capture
   commands above) + `git rev-parse --short HEAD`.
4. Fill every `Median` / `Sequential` / `Auto` cell from criterion stdout.
5. Commit: `chore(bench): refresh BENCHMARKS.md (<short hardware string>)`.

## Out of scope

- CI bench jobs — benchmarks are local-only and sequential (CI only lints the
  invocation hygiene; it never executes benches).
- Cross-host comparison automation.
- Donor regression-target comparison (lives in gitignored
  `_design/perf-baselines.md`).
